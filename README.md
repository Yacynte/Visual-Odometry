# Visual-Odometry
Stereo Visual Odometry Algorithm A Python-based stereo visual odometry algorithm that estimates camera motion by processing consecutive stereo image frames. The algorithm leverages depth triangulation and feature extraction to provide accurate pose estimates in meters, using the KITTI dataset for testing and validation.
